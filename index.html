                <p>
                    Hello! my name is Olivia, I am 19 years old and I am currently enrolled at Algonquin College. I very
                    much enjoy this program so far, and cannot wait to graduate and hopefully find some work in the web
                    development field. Web Dev is my favourite class in this program. I'd love to learn Javascript, PHP,
                    and maybe even dive into learning languages like C#, C++, and python. My goal is to create a good
                    portfolio so I can find a decent job and afford to move out and be financially stable. I'd like to
                    be able to work from remotely so that I don't have to worry about commuting every day. I am
                    optimistic for a great semester!
                </p>
